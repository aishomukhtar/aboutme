    <p><em>about me</em></p>
    <p> I am a dedicated and ambitious student with a strong background in computer science and software development. Throughout my academic career, I have gained a solid foundation in a variety of programming languages including Python, Java, C, and C#. I have always been fascinated by the power and versatility of technology, and I have been driven to learn more and expand my skillset.

        In addition to my studies, I have also been actively engaged in extracurricular activities that have allowed me to further explore my interests in technology. For example, I have participated in coding competitions and hackathons, which have provided me with valuable experience and allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.
        
        Currently, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in web and mobile development. I am particularly interested in the Flutter framework and its ability to create high-performance, cross-platform apps. I am also actively learning iOS development and I am excited to bring my skills to the mobile platform.
        
        Overall, I am confident that my strong educational background and passion for technology will serve me well as I continue to pursue a career in software development. I am eager to take on new challenges and continue to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
